Welcome to the TIM's documentation!
=====================================

TIM is the successor to the Irish TIMES model (Ó Gallachóir et al., 2020), which has a long (more than 10 years) history of providing analytical input to Irish energy policy development, including acting as the basis for Ireland’s first low-carbon roadmap in 2015 (Deane et al., 2013) and for developing energy pathways consistent with the Paris Agree
ment (Glynn et al., 2019), to which Ireland is a signatory. TIM is a new model and has been developed to better inform increased national climate mitigation ambition, to take into account the changing energy technology landscape, and to take advantage of new advances in energy systems optimisation modelling techniques.
