TIMES-Ireland Model (TIM) Documentation
=======================================

The TIMES-Ireland Model (TIM) is Ireland's national energy system optimization model, developed to support evidence-based energy and climate policy analysis. Built on the internationally recognized TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) framework, TIM provides a comprehensive, technology-rich representation of Ireland's entire energy system from primary resource supply through to final energy service demands.

About TIM
---------

TIM is the successor to the Irish TIMES model (O Gallachoir et al., 2020), which has a long history (more than 10 years) of providing analytical input to Irish energy policy development. Key contributions include serving as the basis for Ireland's first low-carbon roadmap in 2015 (Deane et al., 2013) and developing energy pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement (Glynn et al., 2019), to which Ireland is a signatory.

TIM represents a significant advancement over its predecessor, developed to:

* Better inform Ireland's increased national climate mitigation ambition, including the legally binding target of net-zero emissions by 2050
* Reflect the rapidly changing energy technology landscape, with updated cost and performance data for emerging technologies
* Incorporate new advances in energy systems optimization modeling techniques
* Provide enhanced sectoral detail to support carbon budget allocation and sectoral emissions ceilings

Key Features
------------

* **Comprehensive sectoral coverage:** Electricity generation, transport, residential and commercial buildings, industry, and agriculture
* **Technology-rich database:** Hundreds of current and future energy technologies with detailed techno-economic parameters
* **Flexible scenario analysis:** Capability to evaluate diverse policy scenarios, technology pathways, and decarbonization strategies
* **Carbon budget compatibility:** Designed to support Ireland's statutory carbon budget framework and Climate Action Plan
* **Open and transparent:** Model, its documentation and data publicly available to support reproducibility and stakeholder engagement

Development and Governance
--------------------------

TIM is developed and maintained by the Sustainability Institute at University College Cork (UCC). The model is regularly updated to reflect the latest policy developments, technology trends, and research advances.
