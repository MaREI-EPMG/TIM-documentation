Model Use Cases and Applications
=================================

The TIMES-Ireland Model (TIM) has been extensively used to support energy and climate policy development in Ireland. This section outlines key use cases across government consultations, policy outputs, and research applications.

Consultations to Government Agencies and Authorities
-----------------------------------------------------

Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TIM has provided analytical support to DCEE (DECC) for:

* Development of Ireland's Climate Action Plans 
* Long-term energy system scenario analysis for the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP)
* Assessment of sectoral emissions reduction pathways
* Evaluation of renewable energy deployment targets and timelines
* Analysis of energy security implications of different decarbonization strategies

Climate Change Advisory Council (CCAC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TIM has contributed to the evidence base for the Climate Change Advisory Council through:

* Carbon budget technical analysis and recommendations
* Assessment of cost-effective emissions reduction pathways across sectors
* Evaluation of technology deployment requirements to meet climate targets
* Analysis of the feasibility and implications of accelerated decarbonization scenarios

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TIM outputs have supported EPA activities including:

* GHG emissions projections for national inventory reporting
* Scenario analysis for Ireland's "With Additional Measures" (WAM) projections
* Assessment of policy measure effectiveness for emissions reductions

Policy Outputs and Reports
--------------------------

Climate Action Plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TIM has been a key analytical tool supporting Ireland's Climate Action Plans:

**Climate Action Plan 2019:**

* Provided initial technology pathway analysis for sectoral decarbonization
* Assessed infrastructure requirements for transport electrification
* Evaluated renewable electricity generation scenarios

**Climate Action Plan 2021:**

* Supported carbon budget allocation methodology
* Analyzed least-cost pathways to 51% emissions reduction by 2030
* Assessed implications of sectoral ceiling scenarios

**Climate Action Plan 2023 and 2024:**

* Updated technology cost assumptions and deployment trajectories
* Evaluated progress tracking against sectoral targets
* Analyzed updated renewable energy and efficiency measures

Carbon Budgets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TIM analysis has directly informed Ireland's statutory carbon budgets:

* Technical analysis supporting the first carbon budget programme (2021-2025, 2026-2030, 2031-2035)
* Sectoral ceiling recommendations and feasibility assessment
* Cost-benefit analysis of different budget allocation approaches
* Sensitivity analysis on technology availability and costs

National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TIM has contributed to Ireland's NECP submissions to the European Commission:

* Long-term decarbonization scenario development (2030, 2040, 2050)
* Renewable energy share projections across electricity, heat, and transport
* Energy efficiency improvement pathway analysis
* Investment requirements and system cost estimates
